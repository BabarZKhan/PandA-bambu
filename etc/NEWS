- better support of multi-ported memories,
- local memory exploitation,
- read-only-memory exploitation,
- support of multi-bus for parallel memory accesses,
- support of unaligned memory accesses,
- better support of pipelined resources,
- improved module binding algorithms (e.g., slack-based module binding),
- support of resource constraints through user xml file,
- support of libc primitives: memcpy, memcmp, memset and memmove,
- better support of printf primitive for RTL debugging purposes,
- support of dynamic memory allocation,
- synthesis of libm builtin primitives such as sin, cos, acosh, etc,
- better integration with FloPoCo library (http://flopoco.gforge.inria.fr/),
- soft-float based HW synthesis,
- support of Vivado Xilinx backend,
- support of Diamond Lattice backend,
- support of XSIM Xilinx simulator,
- synthesis and testbench generation of WISHBONE B4 Compliant Accelerators (see http://cdn.opencores.org/downloads/wbspec_b4.pdf for details on the WISHBONE specification),
- synthesis of AXI4LITE Compliant Accelerators (experimental),
- inclusion of GCC regression tests to test HLS synthesis (tested HLS synthesis and RTL simulation),
- inclusion of libm regression tests to test HLS synthesis of libm (tested HLS synthesis and RTL simulation),
- support of multiple versions of GCC compiler: v4.5, v4.6 and v4.7.
- support of GCC vectorizing capability (experimental).

Main contributions to this release come from Fabrizio Ferrandi, Christian Pilato, Marco Minutoli, Marco Lattuada, Vito Giovanni Castellana and Silvia Lovergine from Politecnico di Milano (Italy).
Many thanks to Jorge Lacoste for his feedbacks and suggestions.
