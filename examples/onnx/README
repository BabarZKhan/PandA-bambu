Folders beginning with '0' and 'e' refer to the "unit tests" and "examples" described in the LeFlow paper, respectively. They all contain a python script to build the ONNX graph, the generated graph, a python script to compile it with TVM, and the final LLVM IR.

Folders beginning with 'i' refer to some Deep Neural Networks model proposed as benchmark in the Imperial College review of CNN-to-FPGA toolflows. For two of them (vgg16 and resnet152v1) it was possible to download a pre-trained ONNX model and compile it with TVM*. ONNX models for the other two models, and for the ones not present here, were not directly compatible with TVM. It was possible to obtain an LLVM IR of alexnet from a MXNet model, and one of googlenet from a Tensorflow model.

Order and numeration of the folders are coherent with how the models are presented in the two papers.

*they are both too big to be uploaded on Github!
