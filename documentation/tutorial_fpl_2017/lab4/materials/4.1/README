The directory contains three files.
The file main.c the C code that we want to translate to Verilog using High-Level
Synthesis (HLS).
The top-level function is test().
The function have_same_checksum() calls checksum(). The code for checksum() is
not implemented using HLS, but is provided by a third party as IP core. The
verilog code for checksum() is in the file checksum.v.
We also have a reference implementation in C (in the file checksum.c) that is
used as golden reference to test the design.

You are required to do the complete the following steps.

1) Do the necessary steps to integrate the checksum() verilog module (contained
in checksum.v) in a HLS design synthesized with bambu. The top-level module of
the final design must be the test() function in main.c.

2) Run the bambu co-simulation flow, on the generated design, to check that
behavior of the generated design is compliant with the golden reference
checksum() implementation written in C and provided in the checksum.c file.

3) Write your own test cases for the whole design, passing them to the
co-simulation workflow through an xml file with the proper format.
