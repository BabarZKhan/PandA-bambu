This example shows how to add a non-supported device to the bambu synthesis flow.
The file xc7z045-2ffg900-VVD.xml has copied from the framework distribution etc/devices/Xilinx_devices/xc7z020-1clg484-VVD.xml and then renamed in xc7z045-2ffg900-VVD.xml.
After copying the file few changes have been made. All of them relates to the new device characteristics: model, package and speed grade.
Here it follows the changed part of the xml file:
    <model value="xc7z045"/>
    <package value="ffg900"/>
    <speed_grade value="-2"/>

Note that the field 
    <family value="Zynq-VVD"/>
refers to the synthesis script stored in etc/devices/Xilinx_devices/Zynq-VVD.xml.
So, the hint.sh will first simulate and then synthesize the C based description using the above specified Zynq device.
