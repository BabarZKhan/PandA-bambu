The primary objective of the PandA project is to develop a usable framework
that will enable the research of new ideas in the HW-SW Co-Design field.

The PandA framework includes methodologies supporting the research on high-level 
synthesis of hardware accelerators, on parallelism extraction for embedded systems, 
on hardware/software partitioning and mapping, on metrics for performance estimation 
of embedded software applications and on dynamic reconfigurable devices.

PandA is free software, free in the sense that it respects the userâ€™s freedom, 
released under the GNU General Public License version 3 and being 
developed at Politecnico di Milano (Italy).

The source files currently distributed mainly cover the high-level synthesis 
of C based descriptions. Patches and pull request could be submitted at https://github.com/ferrandi/PandA-bambu while stable releases are available for download through this 
page http://panda.dei.polimi.it/?page_id=81. Documentation and Install instructions could be found on this website: http://panda.dei.polimi.it/ .
